# Purpose
This is just a replica of the class that 'The Primeagen' has for teaching git.  I understood all of the parts of git that I needed for working in a team of one:
1) make changes to files.
2) *git add .*
3) *git commit -m "message"*
4) *git push origin main*

Plus simple log statements, etc., but I really needed a bit more in terms of useful tools and the plumbing of git... it's all too simple, and at the same time too complicated once more people are involved.
